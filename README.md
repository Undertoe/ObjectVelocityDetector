# ObjectVelocityDetector

Origional Project fork: https://github.com/AustinA/ObjectVelocityDetector

Primary focus from my development: 
- Lidar Interface using PCL
- Threading / pipelining 

Performs sensor fusion using a VLP-16 lidar and a BlackFly camera to determine the velocities of detected objects from TensorFlow.

System requirements:
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Python 2.7
* TensorFlow
* One of the object detection models from Tensor Flow's model zoo

Required Drivers and External Libraries
* pcl 1.8x (will need to be compiled for 16.04, look at installPCL.sh)
* FlyCaptureSDK from FLIR
* PyCaptureSDK from FLIR

Required linux library packages:
* opencv
* opencv-dev
* libpython-dev
* libpython
* python-dev
* python-matplotlib
* python-pip

Required Python2.7 packages (using pip):
* opencv-python
* tensorflow (preferebly tensorflow-gpu if a GPU is present that is CUDA 9.0 compatible)
* numpy
* Cython
* contextlib2
* pillow
* lxml

InstallPCL.sh will download all required dependencies, compile and install the PCL library.

The expand_usb_core_mem.sh script must be used to expand the USB buffer memory before running this program, or else segmentation faults will occur.

Because of some unknown path appending issues in the Python runtime, the compiled executable MUST run in the same directory as the python modules and main.py. The program will terminate otherwise.
